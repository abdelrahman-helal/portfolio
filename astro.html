							In a couple of days, we will witness the anniversary of one of the
							most important Astronomy Scientists in History “Martin Shmedit”
						</p>
						<p>
							It all started on the day of 5th of February 1963 when Martin
							discovered the first-ever Quasar and here is a brief introduction
							about what he discovered.
						</p>
						<p>
							Firstly, Quasar is short for “Quasi Staller Radio Sources” which
							basically is because they’re detected by Radio Telescopes either
							on earth or in space.
						</p>
						<p>
							Postscript: You can see Quasars with basic telescopes, but they
							will just appear as a regular star. However, there will be a huge
							difference between a picture on a regular telescope and a picture
							on a radio telescope in which we will talk about now.
						</p>
						<p>
							Scientists call the Quasar “The Most Distant, The Brightest, and
							The Farthest.”
						</p>
						<p>
							If we explain each one of those, we would require a report for
							each one but we will try to make it simple.
						</p>
						<p>
							Let’s first explain how a quasar is formed; From what
							Astrophysicists know, most - if not all- Supermassive black holes
							are in the center of galaxies, and there is something called
							accretion disk which consists of the matter revolving around the
							black hole and they’re always very swift and have huge velocity
							when they get close to the black hole because of the huge
							gravitational force. During this revolution, there is an intense
							interaction between this matter, which generates a lot of
							radiation and charged particles that get attracted to the black
							hole’s magnetic field forming the “Quasar Jet.”
						</p>
						<p>
							The particles inside the Quasar jet can move huge distances and in
							some cases, the displacement of them can be 1.5 Million Light
							years, larger that the galaxy in which the quasar was formed. That
							shows why it’s called the most distant
						</p>
						<p>
							And now with the brightest, the brightness of one Quasar is
							minimally about 100 times the brightness of the milky way galaxy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, it’s called the furthest because the furthest thing we
							were able to see in the universe is the ULAS J1120+0641 which is a
							Quasar that has a distance of about 29 Billion Light years from
							Earth. Don’t get astonished and confused by the number, you read
							it correctly. Even, the closest Quasar from us is 730 Million
							light years away.
						</p>
						<p>
							Scientists told us that if we could see the Quasar Exactly when it
							is formed after the explosion it would give us tons of information
							about its nature and physical properties.
						</p>
						<p>
							Quasars are one of the million things we are trying to understand
							in the universe and they are one of the scientists most acquired
							goals like Stephen Hawking said: “My goal is simple, it is to
							complete the understanding of the universe, why it is as it is,
							and why it exists at all.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div data-paragraph="second">
						<p>
							Everything in the universe has laws that control it and explain
							its movement and properties. This is normal, but it is not normal
							that these laws vary entirely depending on the size of the body
							and its mass. this difference leads to a semi-contradictory
							situation between them.
						</p>
						<p>
							After many researches and tests, the scientists agreed to make
							each class have its own laws that apply to it even if the
							equations of each class contradict the equations of a second
							class, but the scientists could not reconcile the use of the laws
							of this category because it is simply correct. You can find that
							objects that exist in our daily lives, such as vehicles, planes,
							and trains, apply Newton's equations of motion, while tiny atomic
							objects apply to the laws of quantum mechanics. But for giant
							objects like planets and stars, they’re controlled by relativity,
							which is the topic of this article.
						</p>
						<p>
							Albert Einstein, the principal founder of theory of relativity,
							divided his research into two parts, or we could say two theories:
							the first theory is the theory of special relativity and the
							second is general relativity.
						</p>
						<p>
							In Einstein’s special relativity, published in 1905, he proved
							that the speed of light is constant, which is approximately
							3×10^8. This is different from the earlier, when the world
							considered that the speed of light is a relative velocity that
							changes depending on where the light is measured. Anyway, after
							the light was placed as a constant, Einstein was able to get to
							the equation E=mc2. This was based on the idea of converting mass
							to energy and vice versa through a process called Nuclear Fusion:
							the merging of the nuclei of two or more atoms. Its most known
							application is the hydrogen bomb.
						</p>
						<p>
							As for the general relativity, published in 1916, it was said that
							time and space meet each other to form the fabric of space-time,
							and in relation to the concept of gravity, Einstein explained that
							large objects such as stars descend beneath this fabric and the
							rest of the objects lighter than them like planets revolve around
							them in the space that bends from the fabric. This subject occurs
							not only with the stars but also with the planets and how the
							moons orbit them and this explains how the planets that have a
							large mass in the solar system such as Jupiter and Saturn cause
							more moons to orbit them unlike the lighter planets.
						</p>
						<p>
							This only an overview of the two theories, but their applications
							extend to describe most of what happens outside the earth’s
							atmosphere.

						<p>
							When the concept of time travel is mentioned, our minds go to one
							of the most complex problems that's associated with it,
							"Grandfather paradox."
						</p>
						<p>
							The Grandfather paradox is a logical problem that must be avoided
							if a person were to time travel, it's the idea that would arise if
							you were to go back in time and kill your grandfather (before he
							could have children) which will make your own birth impossible,
							but won't that make you not even existing? If so, how did you
							actually do such action? Where are you now and what's your place
							in the universe?
						</p>
						<p>
							To solve such a problem one of the solutions suggested that you
							going back in time actually makes an alternative universe with
							different events where you didn't exist and your grandfather is
							dead, as we saw in" X-men days of the future past" going back in
							time and recreating events make a whole new universe as we said
							before and such thing was also mentioned in "Avengers: end game "
							However, Let's say there are no alternative universes, no such
							simple solutions, what would really happen?
						</p>
						<p>
							This loop of events is actually two entangled histories happening
							in parallel. To understand this phenomenon, we first need to know
							about "Quantum superposition." It states a physical system may be
							in one of many configurations—arrangements of particles or
							fields—then the most general state is a combination of all of
							these possibilities and so.
						</p>
						<p>
							If the universe did exist in a superposition of two states (your
							grandfather is alive and your grandfather is dead) then the
							natural result is a superposition of two states (You are born and
							able to go back in time and kill your grandfather and you are not
							born) So somehow this loop is not consistent, and there is really
							a paradox.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, we must remember that time loops, according to our
							current knowledge and technology, are nearly impossible. So, the
							only paradox here is how our thinking can be twisted enough to
							dream about time travelling and killing our grandfathers!!

					<div data-paragraph="fourth">
						<p>
							About 4.5 billion years ago, in the dark space in one of the milky
							way arms, lied a cloud of gas and dust that started to collapse on
							itself because of gravity; the particles were fighting against
							this pressure, and the temperature rose to some million
							Fahrenheits. When the temperature was high enough, the hydrogen
							gas gained the power to undergo nuclear reactions and announce the
							birth of our closest star, the sun.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once the sun started nuclear reactions, it entered a phase called
							Main Sequence, which is the main stage in the life of a star. In
							this stage, the star generates energy from nuclear fusion. Simply,
							it merges four hydrogen atoms into one helium atom. Since the mass
							of the helium atom is less than the combined mass of the four
							hydrogen atoms, this mass defect is converted to energy in the
							form of neutrinos and gamma rays. The calculations state that the
							sun fuses almost 600 million tons of hydrogen each second that
							result in the generation of 3.84 × 10^26 joule of energy.
						</p>
						<p>
							This process will continue for 10 billion years ( 4.5 of them
							passed already) until most of the hydrogen in the core is
							converted into helium. When this occurs, the sun will no longer be
							a main sequence star. It becomes a Red Giant. It will merge the
							helium into beryllium atoms, its radius will be nearly 100 times
							the current radius, and the surface temperature will decrease.
						</p>
						<p>
							When the fusion stops, there won’t be any energy or pressure
							balancing the tremendous gravity of the sun. So, the sun’s mass
							will collapse on itself until it reaches a point in which
							electrons of the core’s atoms can’t be compressed anymore. At this
							moment, the sun becomes a White Dwarf, with very high density,
							high surface temperature, small radius, and rapid rotation.
							Finally, it will continue to shine for some years until it cools
							and becomes a dark body in the space.

					<div data-paragraph="fifth">
						<p>
							Venus is typically the brightest object in the sky most of the
							days, now you may think, if it's a planet how can it shine in the
							sky? That’s because Venus reflects as much as 70% of the light
							that reaches it from the sun. It’s why it can appear so bright as
							much as the moon. It’s frequently seen in the sky in contrast to
							the other planets in our solar system. And as a matter of fact, It
							was named after the Roman Goddess of love. That’s like the
							Egyptian Goddess Isis.
